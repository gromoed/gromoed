### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a beginner Python developer and a student passionate about learning and building useful things with code.  
Currently focusing on backend development with Python, FastAPI, and SQLAlchemy.  
I'm also learning about databases, web APIs, and software development best practices.

ðŸŒ± I'm always looking to improve my skills and explore new technologies.  
ðŸ“š I believe in learning by doing â€” most of my projects are experiments and stepping stones.  
ðŸ’¬ Feel free to reach out or check out my repositories!

Thanks for visiting my profile!
